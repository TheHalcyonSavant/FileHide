Hidding files from WinXP FileSystem with FileHide
=======================================
This is a Win32 C++ project used for hiding files by its filename from the core FileSystem in Windows XP. To use the compiled FileHide.exe successfully, you must first make *SSDT_Hook.sys* from [SSDT_Hook](../../../SSDT_Hook) project. Also, make sure you have chosen Bulgarian System Locale in [Control Panel](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/change-the-system-locale) (this is required for the readability of the GUI form's Bulgarian labels).  

*This project is part of my thesis defense done in 2010 at Technical University of Sofia(Bulgaria) during my graduation in Faculty of Computer Science and Control (FKSU)*
